# Thermal Conductivity, Conductance, Resistance
This page is based on the architectural science textbook {cite:p}`szokolay_introduction_2014` Pg 8-9.

- Thermal Conductivity (W/m.K): the heat flow density (W/m2) in a 1 m thick body (i.e. the length of heat flow path is 1 m), with a 1 degree temperature difference.

- Thermal Conductance (W/K): Conductivity divided by the thickness of the material. 

- Thermal Transmittance/ U-value (W/m2.K): the heat flow density (W/m2) with 1 K temperature
difference (DT) between air inside and air outside.


- Thermal Resistance/ R-value (m2.K/W):
